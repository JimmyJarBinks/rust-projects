# Toaster
Recently, I've been looking for ways to develop good posture habits while I am on the computer. I figured what better way than to have the computer remind me. By using crates such as winrt-notification and tokio, I was able to construct a relatively small script to send me toast notifications every 15 minutes to remind me to better my posture. 

# How to Use
* Run ```cargo build --release``` to build the executable.
* The executable can be run directly or by calling ```cargo run``` in the project directory.
